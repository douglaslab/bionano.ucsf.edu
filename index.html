<h2>What are we doing?</h2>
<p>We aim to use the building blocks of life to create novel tools and devices to perform useful tasks on the nanoscale.  A short introduction to our research can be found <a target="_new" href="http://youtu.be/ITtGJUGXFKc">here</a>.</p>

<h2>How do we do it?</h2>
<p>We build with biomolecules, especially DNA and proteins, thus most of our work is focused on molecular design and related method development.  We also write a lot of software to support these efforts.</p>
