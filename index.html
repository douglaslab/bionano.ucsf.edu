<h2>What are we doing?</h2>
<p>We aim to use the building blocks of life to create novel tools and devices to perform useful tasks on the nanoscale.  A short introduction to our research can be found <a target="_new" href="http://youtu.be/ITtGJUGXFKc">here</a>.</p>

<h2>How do we do it?</h2>
<p>We build with biomolecules, especially DNA and proteins, thus most of our work is focused on molecular design and related method development. We leverage a lot of computation to support these efforts.</p>


<h2>What computation?</h2>
<p>We are collaborating with <a href="https://dynamicland.org/">Dynamicland</a> to reimagine how computation is used in the science lab. We've outlined our guiding principles and long-term vision in <a href="https://dynamicland.org/2024/The_communal_science_lab.pdf">this document</a>.
