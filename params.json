A short video introduction to our research can be found [here](http://youtu.be/ITtGJUGXFKc).\r\n\r\n### How do we do it?\r\n\r\nWe build with biomolecules, so we can rely on well-established techniques from molecular biology such as cloning, gel electrophoresis, and electron microscopy. We also write a lot of software to facilitate our design process.","google":"UA-34346466-1"}
